A weak writing sparkled by Rajamouli's extraordinary mass elements and Ram Charan & Jr. NTR's larger-than-life characters,"RRR (2022) : Movie Review -

High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with ""Saaho"" and ""Radhe Shyam"". Let's just accept the fact that a film like ""Bahubali : The Conclusion"" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.

RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.

RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what ""mass cinema"" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.

RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while ""Naacho Naacho,"" I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. ""Dosti"" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and ""Komuram Bheemudo"" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear ""Raamam Raaghavam"" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.

It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed ""Big-Screen Experience"" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and ""The Lion King"" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!

"If you'd like to see an Indian movie and aren't just looking for romance, this would be a good place to start","The Cinemark near me has started to show Indian movies. Not feeling like sitting home tonight, I decided to catch this one, and luck was with me.

My image of Indian movies, I confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going.

There is a love story here, but it's not the focus of the film. There are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few. (The men's dancing, extremely athletic, astounded me.)

Rather, this movie focuses on the story of two young men in 1920s India who, each in his own way, are fighting against the English occupiers.

The English are portrayed as inhuman monsters. Very often, they made me think of the worst atrocities committed by the Germans in France during World War II, or the most rabid racists in the American South. The first time we see the two male leads dancing, a link is indeed made between the Indians and what appear to be Black American musicians.

Every time the Indians manage to take revenge on the English for their inhuman abuse of the Indians, you cheer - but at times I wondered if I would have cheered watching a parallel movie about Blacks taking revenge on white racists who had mistreated them in the American South, especially if I had been in a movie theater where, like tonight, I was the only audience member who did not belong to the oppressed population. Imagine Spike Lee, for example, able to make a movie in which he did not have to worry about selling tickets to whites as well as Blacks, and you have some idea of how anti-British colonials this movie is. It is the difference between a society in which the oppressor was a small minority of the population vs. Here, where Blacks are a minority of the American population. I don't want to push this comparison too far. The movie only makes the connection in one scene. But this is very definitely a movie that focuses on the story of a brutally oppressed people seeking freedom from an inhuman oppressor, rather than just a series of dance numbers.

I don't speak any of the Indian languages used in the movie, but I had no problem following what was going on with the subtitles, which were almost always easy to read. I'm sure there were cultural references I didn't catch, however, especially at the end in the final big dance number, which seemed to be presenting India as a nation of different regions and cultures all united in one.

The director and cinematographer definitely deserve praise. There was one very striking visual image after the next, especially during the battle scenes. Ram Charan, dressed as a ""native warrior""-if that term means anything anymore-flying through flames was breathtaking.

So, if you've even been curious about Indian movies, give this one a try. Yes, it's three hours long, but trust me, the time goes flying by. This is truly an action movie, a mixture of visual fantasy and often very graphic realism that held my interest to the end.","the cinemark near me has started to show indian movies. not feeling like sitting home tonight, i decided to catch this one, and luck was with me. my image of indian movies, i confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going. there is a love story here, but it's not the focus of the film. there are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few.

High Voltage EnteRRRtainment,,,,,,,[],,
"Ravishing, Refreshing, Recommendable.","If Magadheera, Eega and the Baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what S. S. Rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker, RRR is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers, eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver: universal entertainment. RRR is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle, and experiencing it in 3D would only make it better. Ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences, RRR is epic in every sense of the word, and truly Ravishing, Refreshing and Recommendable.

The film might be around three hours long, but it never actually feels like a long film. In fact, times flies by really quick while watching RRR, an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the U/A rating. The cinematography, the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film, aside from the terrific performances by Jr. NTR, Ram Charan and others. Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles. One more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun. And then, we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck, which is what any action buff could ask for.

Plus, director S. S. Rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his film's two heroes, giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the ""main hero"". Also, the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings. Editing is razor-sharp and the sets look grand. RRR only reinstates the fact that S. S. Rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in India and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him. I would definitely recommend watching RRR and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end, otherwise you might miss some important parts. This is what cinema exists for, and you don't need to think too much before booking your tickets.","if magadheera, eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s. s. rajamouli is capable

Vintage Bollywood!,,,,,,,[],,
The best pan Indian film,"The first Rajamouli film I saw was Magadheera. It was a revelation at that time for me that an Indian action film can look this good. The way it combined its own version of mythology and made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though I had so many issues during the modern times in that movie. But I could see that was some Telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time. Then Eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better. Then Bahubali became a national sensation but even though I liked that film, I was disappointed because I felt like Magadheera should have been the success Bahubali was. Other than the great war scenes and a few things here and there I didn't really like it as much as the previous two films I liked. Bahubali 2 was an even bigger disappointment as I didn't like it at all. So I was going into RRR with caution but it easily became my favourite film of his.

Right from the start, with the intro of Ramcharan, there were many things about it that defied expectations. We see the hero of the movie in a completely negative light in an impossible action setpiece. The scene is crafted in such a way that even if we know that is not possible, we don't question it. The film is filled with so many moments like that where the action setpieces blow your mind and if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work. The entry of Jr. NTR during the action scene right before the interval was another moment that was mindblowing.

The use of patriotism and the mythological parallels were beautifully done. Even the wind rousing the character at a moment felt like it is referencing Bheem/Hanuman, the name and the action done by that character being sons of Vayu, the wind god in mythology. There are a lot of issues in the film, but the existence of this film in this form itself is a wonder as far as I'm concerned. The best film to come out under the so-called ""pan-Indian"" label.","the first rajamouli film i saw was magadheera. it was a revelation at that time for me that an indian action film can look this

2nd best Telugu film,"The first day back2back shows, first in Tamil 3D and the consecutive show in Hindi IMAX 3D.

I think this is the 2nd best movie from the Telugu industry, just next to the same director's Baahubali 2.

Story or plot-wise, there's nothing special but the making is where the film stands out.

Visually very engaging, emotionally connecting and there's rarely a scene that is wasted, every single frame has been used.

If you don't compare this to the director's previous films, then it'd be an amazing treat for sure and to some extent, it even goes beyond the expectations. Raajamouli is the only director who can do this magic repeatedly.

The 2 protagonists' best movie is also this one only, I suppose.

Certainly like other films, there are some cons but the pros surpass them easily as it was a refreshing experience watching a nice masala movie after a long time.","the first day back2back shows,

"When the movie ends, it was like completing the festival celebration","RATED 10/10 Language: Telugu Media Partner: Zee5 Source: Nil HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Movie starts with two hero introductions, that itself like full meals satisfaction...Really the trailer shown the 30% of the movie, it has much more action blocks and goosebumps moments in the movie... its real double treat. Mass moments also doubled with dual heroes... Naattu song is the cherry on top, whole theatre goes mad on this one... the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one, even though we can guess this one, but cant guess the scale...

Second half starts with bit slow flashback, but it picks up to the peak immediately. Second half has more sentiments and more screen space for RC. RC outshines NTR in lot of places... All the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable.... After credit Janta song has cameo from Rajamouli. When the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebration....

What makes a mission more than just a motivation and an ambitious goal!!,"What worked: I personally felt this was superior Rajamuli movie compared to his former projects. One of the things that makes it a choice of the moviegoers is the ability to connect with the audience, making it a mass entertainer with its Elements of what we call a masala movie going experience. Ajay Devgn left a mark, short lived but a pivotal role so I am glad he made his impact in the movie. Both the leads were great in their roles and I would choose Ramcharan if I had to pick one , partially because he had a better narrative and also his acting. The production team put their work on right note and as a whole the movie worked. This movie is better than other projects that the director has been part of, both in execution and overall production value. The movie connects mostly with the audience, making it an entertainer and a enjoyable experience. Unlike his previous movies, it has less dull moments and over the top acting performances, but putting them in the context and applied when necessary. A big shout to the composer and the score; it's a treat. So, the movie works on the most part, which makes it a entertainer and a movie package to be celebrated rather than reviewed and analyzed. Bottomline is it works and the right chords are put together in this movie : What did not work: If I had chance, I would have worked on some technical aspect of the movie. Though better than previous movies, there were some room for improvements in editing and vfx team. Also, I would have been glad if the narratives had strong command, even more strong reasoning and motivations that guide the missions of the characters. Not saying, it's not there, but subtexts and sub layers would have made it better.

Final verdict: it's a better Rajamuli project, and he has improved as a filmmaker. It does deserve a theatrical watch.","what worked: i personally felt this was superior rajamuli movie compared to his former projects. one of the things that makes it a choice of the moviegoers is the

It's HUGE,"Sameer lodaya

The movie is a HUGE entertainer and it has to be because it's RAJAMOULI

the story is simple of two characters who fights for their purposes but it has presented in a very HUGE way..the entry of two heroes were extravaganza and was beyond imagination..the action was terrific and thumping.. the dance sequence showed In a song were very unique and energetic..the director has kept his brand and delivered more than expectations..both the heroes played their roles according to the directors HUGE brand..the impact of the scenes can be felt as audiences were whistling and howling..your expectations to see a BAAHUBALI makers film will not fail

The negative parts are both alia and ajay were kept for Hindi audiences and were given very tiny roles...some scenes were over dramatic and nearly to ham scenes..songs were not up to the mark..at times you will feel the movie is dragged and loses its pace

Not Bad,"That's all it is. The script is not strong enough. The writing couldn't make me feel for any one of the characters. Ram Charan did a really good job. Jr NTR's performance fell out of control. Talents like Samudrakani and Aliya were underutilized. MM Keeravani's score and songs were not as good as expected.

Ram Charan's intro was awesome. Also, the scene with so many animals was awesome. Felt the Rajamouli effect during these scenes. Other than that, I didn't find anything impressive in the movie.","that's all it is. the script is not strong enough. the writing couldn't make me feel for any one of the characters. ram charan did a really good job. jr ntr's performance fell out of control. talents like samudrakani and aliya were underutilized. mm keeravani's score and songs were not as good as expected. ram charan's intro was awesome. also, the scene with so many animals was awesome. felt the rajamouli effect during these scenes. other than that, i didn't find anything impressive in the movie.",thats all it is the script is not strong enough the writing couldnt make me feel for any one of the characters ram charan did a really good job jr ntrs performance fell out of control talents like samudrakani and aliya were underutilized mm keeravanis score and songs were not as good as expected ram charans intro was awesome also the scene with so many animals was awesome felt the rajamouli effect during these scenes other than that i didnt find anything impressive in the movie,thats all it is the script is not strong enough the writing couldnt make me feel for any one of the characters ram charan did a really good job jr ntrs performance fell out of control talents like samudrakani and aliya were underutilized mm keeravanis score and songs were not as good as expected ram charans intro was awesome also the scene with so many animals was awesome felt the rajamouli effect during these scenes other than that i didnt find anything impressive in the movie,thats script strong enough writing couldnt make feel one characters ram charan really good job jr ntrs performance fell control talents like samudrakani aliya underutilized mm keeravanis score songs good expected ram charans intro awesome also scene many animals awesome felt rajamouli effect scenes didnt find anything impressive movie,that script strong enough writing couldn make feel one characters ram charon really good job jr its performance fell control talents like samudrakani alive underutilized mm keeravanis score songs good expected ram charles into awesome also scene many animals awesome felt rajamouli effect scenes didn find anything impressive movie,"['that', 'script', 'strong', 'enough', 'writing', 'couldn', 'make', 'feel', 'one', 'characters', 'ram', 'charon', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'jr', 'its', 'performance', 'fell', 'control', 'talents', 'like', 'samudrakani', 'alive', 'underutilized', 'mm', 'keeravanis', 'score', 'songs', 'good', 'expected', 'ram', 'charles', 'into', 'awesome', 'also', 'scene', 'many', 'animals', 'awesome', 'felt', 'rajamouli', 'effect', 'scenes', 'didn', 'find', 'anything', 'impressive', 'movie']",that script strong enough write couldn make feel one charact ram charon realli good job jr it perform fell control talent like samudrakani aliv underutil mm keeravani score song good expect ram charl into awesom also scene mani anim awesom felt rajamouli effect scene didn find anyth impress movi,that script strong enough write couldn make feel one charact ram charon realli good job jr it perform fell control talent like samudrakani aliv underutil mm keeravani score song good expect ram charl into awesom also scene mani anim awesom felt rajamouli effect scene didn find anyth impress movi

(F)estival. (F)or. (F)ans.,"The greatest achievement is not making an industry defining franchise but to give the right follow up to it. Expectations are higher, challenges are higher and the chances of a misfire is at its highest. Visionary directors like Spielberg and James Cameron have proven it on the biggest stage but in Asian cinema, Rajamouli has established himself as the master of making magnum opus movies.

The Bahubaali films aside from being box office behemoths, helped Telugu film industry to be popular across the country. Naturally, RRR is expected to reach that benchmark and it does largely to the fantastic lead performances from Ram Charan and Junior NTR. After multiple delays due to the pandemic, RRR hit screens at the right moment without compromising the post production work to hit the screens quickly.

On a technical scale, it outdoes Bahubaali considerably. Even the unrealistic action sequences exhilirate you so well that you forget about the logic going out of the window. The criticisms of RRR is it's lack of screentime and proper writing for it's female characters. Like all Indian films it has the troupe of a damsel waiting to be rescued by our macho hero. While Junior NTR and Ram Charan play compelling leads it's tough not to wonder if they were playing The Hulk and Thor, considering they are unfazed by wild animals and bullet injuries.

Ultimately RRR is a well made semi-fictional historical drama with the right amount ""mass"" movements to satisfy the audience. Rajamouli has clearly done his homework and has shown us again why he is the most consistent director in Telugu cinema.","the greatest achievement is not making an industry defining franchise but to

What happened to S.S Rajamouli ? 9.1 ??,,,,,,,[],,
A masterfully made epic,"An extravagantly epic project in Indian cinema can only be done by a few and Rajamouli comfortably tops the list. Rajamouli knows to infuse cinematic brilliance amidst his huge larger-than-life, over-the-top storytelling. The visual glamour which he presents in his films is thoroughly satisfying and pleasing to watch.

RRR is a film dipped in extreme tropes of commercialism, and still, there is a sense of realism in the characters and the events he presents throughout the film. The characters in the film are driven by typical human desires, what I mean to say you could realize every person's motive behind their actions which doesn't seem over the top rather it's how they execute their motives to achieve them is.

The action set pieces are constructed extremely well, though that doesn't deny the fact that they are not logical, still, the build-up of every action sequence is infused with adrenaline rush and jaw-dropping visual splendor. The visual mastery of Rajamouli is instrumental in the epic sequences.

Amidst all the visual extravaganza, there lies a simple storyline that is well balanced in three parallel screenplays. The fact that the story moves conventionally, not taking any absurd twists and turns to invoke a shock works because the nature of the film is thoroughly simplistic.

The characters of Ram Charan and NTR mix well to form an exciting bromance story to screen. Both of them are fueled by opposite motivations, and that contrast adds more to their chemistry. NTR and Ram Charan of them were splendid in their roles and Rajamouli's script seems tailor-made for them.

The film surely loses points in the comic scenes and takes down the watching experience a bit, but that doesn't last very long. The third act loses integrity and believability, although the visual brilliance has not left the film not for a single moment there too.

The antagonists are strictly one-dimensional, though adding layers to their character was not necessary. The melodrama Rajamouli invokes in the film sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't.

The scenes of both the introductions of NTR and Ram charan were splendidly constructed and executed, both scenes deserve special mention.

In an epic film of the highest proportions, Rajamouli delivers what he is expected. The indelible cinematic quality of a mass film is quite rare to achieve and Rajamouli has done that quite well.","an extravagantly epic project in indian cinema can only be done by a few and rajamouli

A RRRiveting Affair,"I almost started this review by saying ""the most anticipated movie is finally.."" but then at this point of time almost every movie is because of what has happened in the last 2 odd years. I am both a big fan and also a big critic of SS Rajamouli's filmmaking. His grandeur is unmatchable but also at times there are some scenes in his movies which ruin the whole experience because of how unreal they are (for example tata sumo jump in Magadheera and human cannonball from Bahubali). With RRR Rajamouli probably creates a great balance between the emotional quotient and the extravaganza. RRR is one of its kind theatrical experience despite not such a great storyline.

I really don't want to say anything about the plot, anyone who has seen a lot of movies can figure out the plot just from the trailer. It is clear that Rajamouli wants to establish the two great characters from the beginning and also wants to do it beautifully by bringing the elements ""Fire and Water"". He has done a very good job by not writing unnecessary characters for the sake of it. The movie is all about the two leading men and it does the justice. It goes without saying that the movie is technically brilliant, costume and set designs are pretty much on point and the camera work is exceptional.

There are two great scenes in the movie involving each of the lead actors that make you gasp and when you walk out of the cinema hall you will be recalling those scenes frame by frame. There are also really over the top scenes, but you know what you signed up for when you are entering Rajamouli's fantasy world. To be honest, I wasn't really a fan of the song ""Naatu Naatu"" when it was released on YouTube, but Ram Charan-NTR's chemistry, the choreography and all the supporting dancers make it a mesmerizing watch. The other songs are also placed well in the movie and MM Keeravani does a commendable job with the background score especially when connecting the mythological elements to it.

I personally feel that the movie is probably a bit too lengthy than it should have been. The narration is crisp in the first half, but in the second half it keeps running around in circles. There are some scenes which almost end like an episode of a TV series and it feels like the story would make a great mini-series. I also think that Rajamouli misses a great opportunity to add some mystery around Ram Charan's character which could have made for a great twist somewhere in the second half. The police station scene almost reminds you of the classic scene from 'Vikramarkudu' and the colour palette is similar as well. Ajay Devgn's character also could have had more build up to it, but I understand the compromise the director had to make for the running time. Ajay Devgn's perfect delivery of three simple English words makes an impactful watch.

RRR is purely written around the two leading characters and both Jr NTR and RamCharan execute their roles to perfection. One can do nothing but applaud for all the efforts and commitment they have shown in the characters and their hard work is clearly evident be it the dance or the fight scenes. Ram Charan has probably put in his career's best performance and to see him in Ram Avatar is some experience in the theaters. Jr NTR is brilliant as well but the writing around his character lacks a bit of depth as compared to the other lead. The rest of the supporting characters have not so much to do and it is good to see that their roles aren't unnecessarily elongated. Although Hollywood actor Ray Stevenson makes for a good evil British officer, the movie suffers from a lack of strong antagonist as the storyline is about Indian freedom struggle. The British characters and accents are more authentic as opposed to other Indian movies but it is also due to the evolution of cinema in general.

Everyone's heard of the phrase ""Actions speak louder than words"" and boy does Rajamouli make it clear with this epic cinematic adventure.","i almost started this review by saying ""the most

Below average film saved by Bromance acting,,,,,,,[],,
NTR Jr.'s performance is the only thing that shines in Rajamouli's latest,"After a delay of almost 2 years, SS Rajamouli's latest magnum opus is finally here. A film that needs to be watched on the big screen to be appreciated for the effort gone into making it. Rajamouli knows his audience really well and the thunderous response that RRR is receiving is proof of that.

RRR follows a familiar template; one that is common to all action films. Two ripped action heroes burst into the screen ridding on expensive set pieces. They meet and their bromance develops but later they realise that they were meant to stop each other. But a few scenes later, they reconcile and join forces. Apply this to the pre-independence era or 100 years later; the result is the same.

Rajamouli is a filmmaker, who lies squarely in between Bhansali & Gowarikar. He goes big with all the grandeur but the plot doesn't match up to all the grandeur. The film stars Ram Charan as Alluri Sitarama Raju (a Telugu revolutionary) & Jr NTR plays Komaram Bheem (revolutionary leader from the Gond tribes). RRR is an entirely fictional story: ""what if the two revolutionaries had met in real life"". I loved NTR's performance the most and the bromance between the leads in the first half. But the second half leaves you disappointed with the usual heavy flying objects and humans. Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgn, Ray Stevenson, Shriya Saran, Olivia Morris, Alison Doody, Rahul Ramakrishna co-star

Personally, I liked RRR more than the two part Bahubali. Bahubali was stretched into two films for no reason & the film was ultimately a big bore. But with RRR, we get a more entertaining and well-paced plot with better performances, high-octane set pieces and foot tapping songs.

RRR has a pulsating and highly entertaining first half (more grounded in terms of set pieces as well). But post-interval, it starts to drag to such an extent that even the bow wielding Ram Charan & the bike flipping NTR Jr. Can't save it.","after a delay of almost 2 years, ss rajamouli's latest magnum

Recommended 👍🏼,"A visual treat, action-packed drama film will keep you entertained with its grand scale action scenes. The movie has very well-choreographed action sequences but lacks the required strong storyline. Director S. S. Rajamouli successfully delivered the mass entertainer once again. He beautifully intertwines two elements of matter 'fire and water' in the form of Rama and Bheem.

Writer K. V. Vijayendra Prasad, the man behind Baahubali, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and Manikarnika has given an ordinary story this time. The co-writer S. S. Rajamouli couldn't manage to make an ordinary story into an extraordinary one. But he knows how to engage its audience and he has done his job. The introduction scenes for both the lead actors, intermission point, and climax were whistle-worthy.

Jr NTR delivers a brilliant and emotional performance. Ram Charan gave an excellent performance, his character has many variations which he showcases impressively. They both look terrific in the action scenes. Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn are making their debut in Telugu films. While Ajay Devgn got a well-written cameo but Alia's character could've been done with better writing. Alia Bhatt and Shriya Saran have nothing to offer here. Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody are effective as the antagonists. Olivia Morris, Edward Sonnenblick, and all other supporting casts play their parts well.

The first half of RRR is a package of emotion, humour, and action. Jr NTR and Ram Charan's dancing and the choreography in 'Naacho Naacho' song deserve applause. NTR manages to bring a few laughs when he tries to befriend Olivia Morris. The screenplay in the second half is a bit slow, some scenes seem unnecessary and they were added just to increase the runtime. There was a large room for editing in the film. VFX and the cinematography were top-notch. The music and the background score were enthralling.

"Pure entertainment, forget logic","The movie serves pure entertainment with no pretense of logic. If you are feeling down or depressed I highly recommend this movie for the sheer energy and joy it brings in some scenes. First half is very good, second half drags a bit but overall gives you a good feel. Special mention of Jr NTR and Ramcharan who have given their all for the movie, physically the movie extracts their blood,sweat and tears and acting wise also they were both very good, If not for any other reason just watch in theatre for the ""Naatu Naatu song"". I always follow lyrics in a song but this one I was so enthralled by the music and dance, I didn't register one line. The song is pure joy to watch.

Missed,"This time Rajamouli missed to make an ordinary story into an extraordinary one . Story was good for a commercial movie . First movie started with terrific intro of Ram and Bheem , each of them intro was very well elevated . First half was really good and interesting , all the commercial elements were very well balanced . Second half was quite boring , and some of the over the top scenes really made it an average one . Both Ram Charan and Jr. NTR gave excellent performance . Ajay Devgn had less screentime , but done his part well. Execepted more screentime for Alia . Technically strong movie . Comparing to our Indian standard , VFX were really topnotch . Action sequence were well choreographed . Mind blowing music and songs . Cinematography was good . Kindly avoid 3D Version , it was really pathetic . Overall worth for money and time , it could've been excellent commercial movie if Second half was well concentrated .

Superhero Flick!,"These movie is different take than bahubali and personally it is ahead of bahubali by visuals but not in area of bahubali by story... So if you are giving me advice to not to compare this with bahubali then my question will be why???

Excepting the comparison movie is truely for mass viewers and class viewers too.. Speciality of Rajamauli sir! Film focuses on two revolutionary superheroes and their journey throughout the life.. At these road there are many conflicts challenge them as a personality.. And these is the basic story with some special elements like fire and ice combination with mythical depictions and character portrail of Ram, Sita, Bheema and Regional moments.. Addition of over the top actions justifying two characters... (Creative actions) with remark of Rajamauli Sir's style with addition of spectacular visuals and outstanding BGM!!! Hushhh... Not over yet cause this is experience.. True cinema experience.. Yes, film is not perfect.. Yet has loopholes.. Yes feels cliche in storytelling like english actors dubbing in hindi to elaborate situation but at the same time it is epic.. mindblowing and heartwhelming too... All credits goes to whole RRR team!!

Loud very loud,"Rajamouli is known for making larger than life movies . This is also same. Following up the adaptation of Ramayana the story portrays english empire as cruel (ok to believe) and stupid at the same time (this one is hard to digest) . Had high hopes after the buzz but did not leave upto the expectations. Lots of plot holes.

Specially focus on the female characters one is given the role of sita (Aliya Bhat). I wonder why she chose this role after classics like raji,udta punjab. It has 0 character arch. She just waits for his Ram. And another one is given the role of ""bibhishan"" . It's a classic case with what not do with female characters. RRR is a world of just masculinity where women are the props.

6 out of 10 for the technical works,"As a story, there is no such twist and turns and non linear activities like that. A straight and almost one line story with the two biggies made it easier. First half was very good even there was no such flaws of screenplay even the run time was almost more than 90 mins. The problem was the second half of the movie, which badly falls. In tha name of emotions they have poorly executed the screenplay which falls desperately. When it comes the vfx's(except animal effects) everything was visibly attractive. The fire and the water act for the actors worked very well in most of the aspects. The climax fight and the making was actually not satisfying when compared to the first half fight sequences. Overall a technicall strong with flaws in some vfx scenes and with the flawly writted second half, yes we can enjoy it once for the technical brilliance.","as a story, there is no such twist and turns

RAJAMOULI HITS BULLSEYE AGAIN!!!,"Stellar performances from NTR. Jr and Ram Charan.

Rajamouli is synonym for perfect filmmaking with absolute precision so lovingly called as 'jakkanna'.

This movie has all typical mouli signature mark moves.

Outstanding performances from cast.

Jaw dropping action sequences.

Top notch visual effects.

Keeravani blend of class and mass mixed with melodious and emotional touch music worked very well just like all Rajamouli movies does.

He absolutely brings best in every cast and crew he works with.

He knows how to convey emotional scenes on screen in a way that hits right chords of audience.

Interval scene is more powerful than any other scenes from movie.

But this movie just falls short of one thing.

After completing every Rajamouli movie we are left with a satisfactory feeling while we leave screen.

But after completing this movie there is a vaccum left in audience.

It maybe because climax is not as powerful as interval or too much emphasis on either of one protagonist or anything that makes us feel there's something that leaves us thinking that something should be done other way around.

Revolutionary movie for India,"The best part of RRR is the visual treat. The graphics were perfect to the beginning to the end.

First half First half is just amazing each scene gives me goosebumps. Jr NTR and Ramcharan were equally amazing. Both of them showns excellent performance. The major plus point of first half is the fight scenes especially the intervel portion.

Second half Second half is good but not as good as first half. Second half is more of a visual treat The problem is action scenes were visually amazing but not so great. It is beyond logic. Other negative is didn't have a good story and Alia didn't have much of a rool.

SS Rajamouli Super Hit Movie,"RRR. Master piece from Master Story Teller...

All I have to say is Movie is beyond expectations.

Both CHARAN and NTR has done never seen before performances and enacted very well in their Roles.

Story is very gripping and Emotional.. CHARAN is soul of the movie. NTR has nailed his role.

CHARAN shown his intensive Acting and Emotional roller coaster performance.

NTR is highlighted for the first half.

Second half is reserved for CHARAN and he dominated with his performance.

Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt did their best.

All expectations of Audience, Rajamouli has delivered more than that in each scene.

Intro , pre - interval, Interval bang post-interval, Pre-Climax & Climax Each part of movie is marvelous.

Story by V Rajendra Prasad sir is awesome thought of bringing two great Freedom Fighters for Nation at one time.

It's ""Once upon a time in Delhi"" for Nation and for freedom movement.

BGM is the major highlight and strength for such a performances and story. Kudos to MM Keeravani.

Cinematography by Senthil is awesome.

Kudos to Action Director Solomon.

All Technicians given the best ever.

One man behind all these "" The Maestro, Magician ""SS RAJAMOULI"" a big vow to you Sir. Salute and Hatsoff .. Words not enough to praise.

"Not bad, but not remotely as good as the hype","The hype for this movie was unreal. But it ended up being just ok-ish, at best. If you dont know anything about the actors playing the heroes in the movie, like me, you will get bored at many points. This movie could be a great treat for mad fans of those celebrities, but the same doesn't hold for non-Telugu audience.

Coming to the making, the thing that bothered me the most was CGI. For the budget, I was expecting much better CGI than Bahubali, but it was just as bad. BB was first such big movie, so the poor CGI was ignored by most. But here, the makers have no excuse as they have spent a ton of money and it has been nearly 6-7 years since BB, so technology has advanced as well. Even a simple fort, crowds, or some bird-view shots of the ground look cheesy. Possibly, the makers spent all the money on marketing and forgot about the product.

Overall, it's an average movie. Dont buy the hype, keep your expectations low, and you wont be disappointed.","the hype for this movie was unreal. but it ended up being just ok-ish, at best. if you dont know anything about the

Blockbuster,"This movie directed by SS Rajamouli is a blockbuster. It is an absolute treat to watch.

Plus Points: There are an unlimited amount of highs in this movie. The highs are on a different level and comparable to Hollywood level and marvel level movies.

Emotionally we get connected a lot in these highs too. For me the interval scene and the komaram bheemuda song scene were the most hard hitting.

SS Rajamouli also shows his genius writing in this movie. He didn't leave cliché moments just to move the story. There is one scene where Rahul Ramakrishna uses a snake to try to kill ram charan by making a sound with a twig, and it clearly shows rajamouli's creativity in the screenplay.

Minus Points: There are some parts in the second half where it is slightly dull. For me personally, the flashback portion was kind of dull and felt elongated. It could've been delivered better but other than that everything else felt seamless in the story and screenplay.

Overall: This is an out and out Rajamouli Action Movie! For action lovers this will be rated as a blockbuster but for people that only come for the story and overall feel could rate it as a hit!

Did Rajamouli manage to balance both the heros, Ntr and Ram Charan?

Although, it revolves around both of them mostly equally, if you would have to classify one of them as the main character then it would be ram charan because of his character arc. Ram charan has an internal conflict and a turning point in the movie whereas Ntr's character is more plain and goes by the same level throughout the film. Due to this we feel as if ram charan's character is more complete and as if we know more about him.

Me, being an ntr fan I was slightly disappointed to see this. I wanted to see more variation, more character, and a more dominant personality for him. I cannot blame this on Rajamouli. He did his absolute best to do justice to the script but I still wish there was a little more to ntr.

Is this better than SS Rajamouli's previous movie bahubali the conclusion? Well, this is a very opinionated question. If you are an action lover and crave for intense and powerful scenes then you would like RRR more. If you watch movies for their stories and the overall feel of it then you would like bahubali 2 more.

Personally, I liked Bahubali better. I felt like I connected with the characters more and that the story line was more complete.

Its a senseless pathetic illogical overrated movie.,"I seriously beleive that the rating shown on Imdb is sham. This movie doesn't deserve an avg rating of even 5. Horrible writing and unrealistic action sequences. Its just the showcase of heavy video effects and nothing more than that.

Just the basic plot of revenge, that can be seen in the 1980s bollywood films. Several crores are spent on just making this movie look grand. Story writers have done a shameful job. Screenplay is cringe.

This movie is just the test of your patience for 3 hours. Brace yourself from this torture.","i seriously beleive that the rating shown on imdb is sham. this movie doesn't deserve an avg rating of even 5. horrible writing and unrealistic action sequences. its just the showcase of heavy video effects and nothing more than that. just the basic plot of revenge, that can be seen in the 1980s bollywood films. several crores are spent on just making this movie look grand. story writers have done a shameful job. screenplay is cringe. this movie is just the test of your patience for 3 hours. brace yourself from this torture.",i seriously beleive that the rating shown on imdb is sham this movie doesnt deserve an avg rating of even 5 horrible writing and unrealistic action sequences its just the showcase of heavy video effects and nothing more than that just the basic plot of revenge that can be seen in the 1980s bollywood films several crores are spent on just making this movie look grand story writers have done a shameful job screenplay is cringe this movie is just the test of your patience for 3 hours brace yourself from this torture,i seriously beleive that the rating shown on imdb is sham this movie doesnt deserve an avg rating of even 5 horrible writing and unrealistic action sequences its just the showcase of heavy video effects and nothing more than that just the basic plot of revenge that can be seen in the 1980s bollywood films several crores are spent on just making this movie look grand story writers have done a shameful job screenplay is cringe this movie is just the test of your patience for 3 hours brace yourself from this torture,seriously beleive rating shown imdb sham movie doesnt deserve avg rating even 5 horrible writing unrealistic action sequences showcase heavy video effects nothing basic plot revenge seen 1980s bollywood films several crores spent making movie look grand story writers done shameful job screenplay cringe movie test patience 3 hours brace torture,seriously believe rating shown limb sham movie doesn deserve ave rating even 5 horrible writing realistic action sequence showcase heavy video effects nothing basic plot revenge seen 1980s bollywood films several cross spent making movie look grand story writers done shameful job screenplay cringe movie test patience 3 hours brace torture,"['seriously', 'believe', 'rating', 'shown', 'limb', 'sham', 'movie', 'doesn', 'deserve', 'ave', 'rating', 'even', '5', 'horrible', 'writing', 'realistic', 'action', 'sequence', 'showcase', 'heavy', 'video', 'effects', 'nothing', 'basic', 'plot', 'revenge', 'seen', '1980s', 'bollywood', 'films', 'several', 'cross', 'spent', 'making', 'movie', 'look', 'grand', 'story', 'writers', 'done', 'shameful', 'job', 'screenplay', 'cringe', 'movie', 'test', 'patience', '3', 'hours', 'brace', 'torture']",serious believ rate shown limb sham movi doesn deserv ave rate even 5 horribl write realist action sequenc showcas heavi video effect noth basic plot reveng seen 1980 bollywood film sever cross spent make movi look grand stori writer done shame job screenplay cring movi test patienc 3 hour brace tortur,serious believ rate shown limb sham movi doesn deserv ave rate even 5 horribl write realist action sequenc showcas heavi video effect noth basic plot reveng seen 1980 bollywood film sever cross spent make movi look grand stori writer done shame job screenplay cring movi test patienc 3 hour brace tortur
Enjoyable action experience with 2 characters who have superpowers (literally),"First of all really good, mature acting by NTR jr. And Ram Charan. The scenes they are together, the bromance between them helped add a soul to the movie.

The production value made it very enjoyable to watch. The close up shots, the well made CGI all took this movie up some notches.

Though the first half was good (like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good), the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti British fetish. The commercial elements was seen everywhere but I guess that was intentional for mass audiences.

It was great to experience it in 3D. Watch it in 3D if you have the chance.","first of all really good, mature acting by ntr jr. and ram charan. the scenes they are together, the bromance between them helped add a soul to the movie. the production value made it very enjoyable to watch. the close up shots, the well made cgi all took this movie up some notches. though the first half was good (like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good), the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti british fetish. the commercial elements was seen everywhere but i guess that was intentional for mass audiences. it was great to experience it in 3d. watch it in 3d if you have the chance.",first of all really good mature acting by ntr jr and ram charan the scenes they are together the bromance between them helped add a soul to the movie the production value made it very enjoyable to watch the close up shots the well made cgi all took this movie up some notches though the first half was good like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti british fetish the commercial elements was seen everywhere but i guess that was intentional for mass audiences it was great to experience it in 3d watch it in 3d if you have the chance,first of all really good mature acting by ntr jr and ram charan the scenes they are together the bromance between them helped add a soul to the movie the production value made it very enjoyable to watch the close up shots the well made cgi all took this movie up some notches though the first half was good like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti british fetish the commercial elements was seen everywhere but i guess that was intentional for mass audiences it was great to experience it in 3d watch it in 3d if you have the chance,first really good mature acting ntr jr ram charan scenes together bromance helped add soul movie production value made enjoyable watch close shots well made cgi took movie notches though first half good like action pretty crazy like unbelievable insane still good second half bit lackluster way simply go anti british fetish commercial elements seen everywhere guess intentional mass audiences great experience 3d watch 3d chance,first really good mature acting nor jr ram charon scenes together romance helped add soul movie production value made enjoyable watch close shots well made chi took movie notes though first half good like action pretty crazy like unbelievable insane still good second half bit lackluster way simply go anti british finish commercial elements seen everywhere guess intentional mass audiences great experience d watch d chance,"['first', 'really', 'good', 'mature', 'acting', 'nor', 'jr', 'ram', 'charon', 'scenes', 'together', 'romance', 'helped', 'add', 'soul', 'movie', 'production', 'value', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'close', 'shots', 'well', 'made', 'chi', 'took', 'movie', 'notes', 'though', 'first', 'half', 'good', 'like', 'action', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'like', 'unbelievable', 'insane', 'still', 'good', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'lackluster', 'way', 'simply', 'go', 'anti', 'british', 'finish', 'commercial', 'elements', 'seen', 'everywhere', 'guess', 'intentional', 'mass', 'audiences', 'great', 'experience', 'd', 'watch', 'd', 'chance']",first realli good matur act nor jr ram charon scene togeth romanc help add soul movi product valu made enjoy watch close shot well made chi took movi note though first half good like action pretti crazi like unbeliev insan still good second half bit lacklust way simpli go anti british finish commerci element seen everywher guess intent mass audienc great experi d watch d chanc,first realli good matur act nor jr ram charon scene togeth romanc help add soul movi product valu made enjoy watch close shot well made chi took movi note though first half good like action pretti crazi like unbeliev insan still good second half bit lacklust way simpli go anti british finish commerci element seen everywher guess intent mass audienc great experi d watch d chanc

EMOTIONALLY FULFILLING EXPERIENCE,"To be brutally honest, all the hype around RRR made me apprehensive whether SS Rajamouli can deliver. I went into the theatre expecting a letdown, as the hype prior to release was reaching stratospheric levels.

I was happy to be proven wrong when I watched the movie. The movie is a fictionalized tale of Alluri Seetharam Raju and Komaram Bheem, who though never met led potent revolutions in the early part of 20th century.

The movie starts with a gut wrenching scene of the Governor and his wife visiting Adilabad for a hunting expedition. During that expedition, a tribal girl catches the attention of the governors wife (played by Allison Daddy) who is adept at skin paintings. She wishes to take the girl to their palace as a showpiece and the Governor willingly obliges. A few coins are thrown at the parents of the girl and she is whisked away. The tribals protest and obstruct the cavalry but they are brutally dealt with.

This is where the audience is introduced to two parallel storylines. In the first storyline, Ramaraju (aka Ram Charan) is a police officer and is blindly siding with the monstrous actions of British to achieve a hidden agenda. In another storyline, Komaram Bheem (aka Jr NTR) is venturing into forests collecting wild animals like wolves and tigers. He is also masquerading as a mechanic at a garage in Delhi. His reason for presence is to get the girl kidnapped by the Governor back to her family.

The story of these two characters then collides, they become great friends but are forced to go apart when their agendas collide. It would be a travesty to reveal anything more about the story.

The storyline is thin, agreed ... but, the way the story is narrated on screen and intertwined with emotions makes it apart. This is exactly where Rajamouli delivers. While the visual spectacle is a given, it never loses track of emotions. That's exactly what makes this movie a potent entertainment experience. For e.g. The interval scene at the party is a visual delight but it also effectively packs the pain and frustration of losing the child to an oppressive government. The scene involving the climax fight is a visual delight but the fight has as much emotion behind it as action.

Lots of directors can make visual spectacles but where they usually fail is the emotional quotient. Look at big budget disasters like Thugs of Hindustan, Kalank, 83 ...

I would not like to say much on audio visual elements like sound, lighting, special effects because it is a given that they will be world class within the budget constraints. I would recommend this movie to any cinema lover. Just go blind and give in yourself to the experience.","to be brutally honest, all the hype around rrr made me apprehensive whether ss rajamouli can deliver. i went into the theatre expecting a

the movie the movie is a fictionalized tale of alluri seetharam raju and komaram bheem who though never met led potent revolutions in the early part of 20th century the movie starts with a gut wrenching scene of the governor and his wife visiting adilabad for a hunting expedition during that expedition a tribal girl catches the attention of the governors wife played by allison daddy who is adept at skin paintings she wishes to take the girl to their palace as a showpiece and the governor willingly obliges a few coins are thrown at the parents of the girl and she is whisked away the tribals protest and obstruct the cavalry but they are brutally dealt with this is where the audience is introduced to two parallel storylines in the first storyline ramaraju aka ram charan is a police officer and is blindly siding with the monstrous actions of british to achieve a hidden agenda in another storyline komaram bheem aka jr ntr is venturing into forests collecting wild animals like wolves and tigers he is also masquerading as a mechanic at a garage in delhi his reason for presence is to get the girl kidnapped by the governor back to her family the story of these two characters then collides they become great friends but are forced to go apart when their agendas collide it would be a travesty to reveal anything more about the story the storyline is thin agreed  but the way the story is narrated on screen and intertwined with emotions makes it apart this is exactly where rajamouli delivers while the visual spectacle is a given it never loses track of emotions thats exactly what makes this movie a potent entertainment experience for eg the interval scene at the party is a visual delight but it also effectively packs the pain and frustration of losing the child to an oppressive government the scene involving the climax fight is a visual delight but the fight has as much emotion behind it as action lots of directors can make visual spectacles but where they usually fail is the emotional quotient look at big budget disasters like thugs of hindustan kalank 83  i would not like to say much on audio visual elements like sound lighting special effects because it is a given that they will be world class within the budget constraints i would recommend this movie to any cinema lover just go blind and give in yourself to the experience,to be brutally honest

Carving but Unnatural,"Set in the 1920's, a short exaggerated outline which primarily focuses on different personalities & common enthusiastic quench among the two main roles. One of them on rescue mission of his kin whereas other fights to free from captivity of colonial power. Both meet as rivals but merged into as a revolutionary to accompany each other and achieve their goals.

A short storyline which could end the movie in a short duration but rebellion is the one, which is stretched to fit into a time frame. There's no space for comedy or romance, a high action packed film. Film making & editing is eye catching.

"Ordinary Story, Extraordinary Direction","First of all, talking about casting, it sucks. Casting NTR and Ram Charan was okay but Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn don't fit in this movie. The sacle in which S. S Rajamouli shot this movie is Epic. Songs were pretty good, i personally loved the folk song sung by the little girl, it literally gave me goosebumps. Most f the people blame the story but the essence of Rajamouli is small story - big scale, he follows this in every one of his movie.

Great boast small roast,"I was super excited about the movie and wanted to watch this so I skipped watching other movies.

To be honest, the movie was not worth it. It is one time watch in theatre. Some of the scenes are really good and a few might give you goosebumps but even those goosebumps aren't enough.

I don't know how can people rate this 9 or even 10/10. It may be because of just being a hardcore fan but this is no way near the best direction of SS Rajamouli. Baahubali remains his best direction till date. RRR is far behind it. He might have to wait few more years to deliver a better gem than Baahubali.

The acting of Ram Charan and NTR is really good and there's nothing much they could have done with such a poor story and script.

Highly disappointed from the movie.","i was super excited about the movie and wanted to watch this so i skipped watching other movies. to be honest, the movie was not worth it. it is one time watch in theatre. some of the scenes are really good and a few might give you goosebumps but even those goosebumps aren't enough. i don't know how can people rate this 9 or even 10/10. it may be because of just being a hardcore fan but this is no way near the best direction of ss rajamouli. baahubali remains his best direction till date. rrr is far behind it. he might have to wait few more years to deliver a better gem than baahubali. the acting of ram charan and ntr is really good and there's nothing much they could have done with such a poor story and script. highly disappointed from the movie.",i was super excited about the movie and wanted to watch this so i skipped watching other movies to be honest the movie was not worth it it is one time watch in theatre some of the scenes are really good and a few might give you goosebumps but even those goosebumps arent enough i dont know how can people rate this 9 or even 1010 it may be because of just being a hardcore fan but this is no way near the best direction of ss rajamouli baahubali remains his best direction till date rrr is far behind it he might have to wait few more years to deliver a better gem than baahubali the acting of ram charan and ntr is really good and theres nothing much they could have done with such a poor story and script highly disappointed from the movie,i was super excited about the movie and wanted to watch this so i skipped watching other movies to be honest the movie was not worth it it is one time watch in theatre some of the scenes are really good and a few might give you goosebumps but even those goosebumps arent enough i dont know how can people rate this 9 or even 1010 it may be because of just being a hardcore fan but this is no way near the best direction of ss rajamouli baahubali remains his best direction till date rrr is far behind it he might have to wait few more years to deliver a better gem than baahubali the acting of ram charan and ntr is really good and theres nothing much they could have done with such a poor story and script highly disappointed from the movie,super excited movie wanted watch skipped watching movies honest movie worth one time watch theatre scenes really good might give goosebumps even goosebumps arent enough dont know people rate 9 even 1010 may hardcore fan way near best direction ss rajamouli baahubali remains best direction till date rrr far behind might wait years deliver better gem baahubali acting ram charan ntr really good theres nothing much could done poor story script highly disappointed movie,super excited movie wanted watch skipped watching moves honest movie worth one time watch theatre scenes really good might give goosebumps even goosebumps agent enough dont know people rate 9 even 1010 may hardware fan way near best direction is rajamouli baahubali remains best direction till date err far behind might wait years deliver better gem baahubali acting ram charon nor really good there nothing much could done poor story script highly disappointed movie,"['super', 'excited', 'movie', 'wanted', 'watch', 'skipped', 'watching', 'moves', 'honest', 'movie', 'worth', 'one', 'time', 'watch', 'theatre', 'scenes', 'really', 'good', 'might', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'even', 'goosebumps', 'agent', 'enough', 'dont', 'know', 'people', 'rate', '9', 'even', '1010', 'may', 'hardware', 'fan', 'way', 'near', 'best', 'direction', 'is', 'rajamouli', 'baahubali', 'remains', 'best', 'direction', 'till', 'date', 'err', 'far', 'behind', 'might', 'wait', 'years', 'deliver', 'better', 'gem', 'baahubali', 'acting', 'ram', 'charon', 'nor', 'really', 'good', 'there', 'nothing', 'much', 'could', 'done', 'poor', 'story', 'script', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'movie']",super excit movi want watch skip watch move honest movi worth one time watch theatr scene realli good might give goosebump even goosebump agent enough dont know peopl rate 9 even 1010 may hardwar fan way near best direct is rajamouli baahubali remain best direct till date err far behind might wait year deliv better gem baahubali act ram charon nor realli good there noth much could done poor stori script highli disappoint movi,super excit movi want watch skip watch move honest movi worth one time watch theatr scene realli good might give goosebump even goosebump agent enough dont know peopl rate 9 even 1010 may hardwar fan way near best direct is rajamouli baahubali remain best direct till date err far behind might wait year deliv better gem baahubali act ram charon nor realli good there noth much could done poor stori script highli disappoint movi

Average and over the top! Belief went for a toss!,"Rajamouli kind of disappoints with this one. Also the huge expectations riding on it makes it even more heart-breaking.

The story and screenplay are bland! There is actually no substance.

The action is over the top.. The heroes have super natural powers n are pummeling 1000s of people with ease, fighting tigers..and c'mon man u r fighting a whole batallion with one person perched on ur shoulders!

Don't Believe the Hype,"I'm just back from watching the movie and it was BEYOND ridiculous. I couldn't take this pile of steaming hot trash seriously for a single minute. It insults the viewers intelligence in a way Fast and Furious 9, Baaghi 3 and Satyamev Jayete 2 did.

I really don't get why directors blow huge amounts of money on special effects that look completely fake and fail to immerse the viewer. The key to good VFX shots is that you are left marvelling at how they achieved that or questioning whether it was even a VFX shot at all. The effects in this movie are laughably bad. And when I say ""laughably"" I mean that literally. I actually laughed hysterically at the bridge scene.

I'm all for suspension of disbelief (which is why I love films like John Wick) but there is a limit man. Seriously.

The story is paper thin and some of the ""acting"" gives a whole new meaning to the term ""overacting"".

Total bakvaas picture and a waste of time. I have it 3 stars because some of the OTT scenes were quite entertaining and Ram Charan gave quite a sincere performance that was made all the more impressive because I can't figure out how he kept a straight face through some of the ridiculousness.

And to the Rajamouli Bhakts who are blindly giving this trash a 10, have some dignity and please develop a better taste in films.","i'm just back from watching the movie and it was beyond ridiculous.

Rajamouli & Team back with a bang,"After the pan-India blockbuster Baahubali-1&2, Rajamouli sir is back with a bang with another appealing story set amidst the freedom struggle. The main characters, played well by Jr. NTR & Ram Charan, have been inspired from lives of two real heroes from Telangana & Andhra - Komaram Bheem & Sitarama Raju.

While I watched the movie in Hindi, but having stayed in the south for so long, I can imagine the reactions this movie in Telugu/Tamil would have generated in the theatres. These kind of films are made to be watched & enjoyed in Cinemas with friends & family. The visuals, background score (Keeravani sir again) and cinematography were excellent. The over-the-top action sequences, again like Baahubali, are the highlights of the movie.

However, at around 3hrs, it was a bit of stretch (unlike the 2 Baahubali movies), and I did catch myself looking elsewhere in the theatre & at my phone at times. I guess it is because Rajamouli is a story teller and often incorporates a lot of ideas from history & mythology.

Nonetheless, an Indian movie worth watching on big screens is a huge respite to those who have been film-starved these past 2 years, with good action & direction.","after the pan-india blockbuster

OVERHYPED?,"The plot seem to be interesting but the story is not.

Movie looks promising but only at some levels.

And some good patriotic gestures.

No doubt from the cast they will make you feel what they are going through with their great acting performances.

Some great dialogue writing but it lacks some great inner feel.

Great cinematography and editing.

Pride of Indian Cinema!,"Brilliant movie from visionary director!

SS Rajamouli is one of the best director's of Indian cinema and he proves yet again. After the mammoth success of Baahubali, it took him almost 5 years to make this movie and man it was worth it!

The mind blowing performance of the cast, the music and the breathtaking visuals makes it a complete package to be watched on the biggest screen possible. I bet the dance sequence of one the songs is the best one has ever seen and will remain a benchmark for years to come.

Ram Charan and NTR shines in what is arguably the best performance of their career. Their hard work and dedication for this movie is clearly visible in every frame they are in.","brilliant movie from visionary director! ss rajamouli is one of the best director's of indian cinema and he proves yet again. after the mammoth success of baahubali, it took him almost 5 years to make this movie and man it was worth it! the mind blowing performance of the cast, the music and the breathtaking visuals makes it a complete package to be watched on the biggest screen possible. i bet the dance sequence of one the songs is the best one has ever seen and will remain a benchmark for years to come. ram charan and ntr shines in what is arguably the best performance of their career. their hard work and dedication for this movie is clearly visible in every frame they are in.",brilliant movie from visionary director ss rajamouli is one of the best directors of indian cinema and he proves yet again after the mammoth success of baahubali it took him almost 5 years to make this movie and man it was worth it the mind blowing performance of the cast the music and the breathtaking visuals makes it a complete package to be watched on the biggest screen possible i bet the dance sequence of one the songs is the best one has ever seen and will remain a benchmark for years to come ram charan and ntr shines in what is arguably the best performance of their career their hard work and dedication for this movie is clearly visible in every frame they are in,brilliant movie from visionary director ss rajamouli is one of the best directors of indian cinema and he proves yet again after the mammoth success of baahubali it took him almost 5 years to make this movie and man it was worth it the mind blowing performance of the cast the music and the breathtaking visuals makes it a complete package to be watched on the biggest screen possible i bet the dance sequence of one the songs is the best one has ever seen and will remain a benchmark for years to come ram charan and ntr shines in what is arguably the best performance of their career their hard work and dedication for this movie is clearly visible in every frame they are in,brilliant movie visionary director ss rajamouli one best directors indian cinema proves yet mammoth success baahubali took almost 5 years make movie man worth mind blowing performance cast music breathtaking visuals makes complete package watched biggest screen possible bet dance sequence one songs best one ever seen remain benchmark years come ram charan ntr shines arguably best performance career hard work dedication movie clearly visible every frame,brilliant movie visionary director is rajamouli one best directors indian cinema proves yet mammoth success baahubali took almost 5 years make movie man worth mind blowing performance cast music breathtaking visual makes complete package watched biggest screen possible bet dance sequence one songs best one ever seen remain benchmark years come ram charon nor shines arguably best performance career hard work education movie clearly visible every frame,"['brilliant', 'movie', 'visionary', 'director', 'is', 'rajamouli', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'indian', 'cinema', 'proves', 'yet', 'mammoth', 'success', 'baahubali', 'took', 'almost', '5', 'years', 'make', 'movie', 'man', 'worth', 'mind', 'blowing', 'performance', 'cast', 'music', 'breathtaking', 'visual', 'makes', 'complete', 'package', 'watched', 'biggest', 'screen', 'possible', 'bet', 'dance', 'sequence', 'one', 'songs', 'best', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'remain', 'benchmark', 'years', 'come', 'ram', 'charon', 'nor', 'shines', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'hard', 'work', 'education', 'movie', 'clearly', 'visible', 'every', 'frame']",brilliant movi visionari director is rajamouli one best director indian cinema prove yet mammoth success baahubali took almost 5 year make movi man worth mind blow perform cast music breathtak visual make complet packag watch biggest screen possibl bet danc sequenc one song best one ever seen remain benchmark year come ram charon nor shine arguabl best perform career hard work educ movi clearli visibl everi frame,brilliant movi visionari director is rajamouli one best director indian cinema prove yet mammoth success baahubali took almost 5 year make movi man worth mind blow perform cast music breathtak visual make complet packag watch biggest screen possibl bet danc sequenc one song best one ever seen remain benchmark year come ram charon nor shine arguabl best perform career hard work educ movi clearli visibl everi frame
A Mass Entertainer,"Either portray the leads to have super human abilities and call them super heroes, or give them humanly strength and portray them only as powerful humans, but you can't and shouldn't portray super humans as normal beings and that too simultaneously. It is a mass entertainer, where heroes can do anything and no one and nothing can hurt them. The heroes can fight a mob of 1000s, can fight lions and tigers, can lift, throw and use a motorcycle with a hand, can get buffed up with one meal a week, can break open a complete hard-iron jail cell, and so on. It is another physics defying movie portraying humans as God (literally too).

First half was still 6/10, but second was just a plain mob pleaser. Continuous fight sequels with dragged storyline. The whole story is: We are friends, I betray you, you betray me, I save you, you save me, we save the world. Two men against the world, still victorious.

Never lost the plot! Kudos SSR.,"The movie runs on a thin script. Very thin script. The biggest merit of this movie is Rajamouli never lost the sight of the story line. There are no deviations happening except for the story. Who is the lead character in this movie? You guessed it.. the freaking story. So gotta give up to the director for making sure the story and purpose is not lost to ensure the actors their due screen presence.

Now coming to what's not great.. well, it's the thin story line. And the movie wasn't engaging at times. Audience took their eyes off the screen here and there to be honest. Never lost the story it wanted to tell.","the movie runs on a thin script. very thin script. the biggest merit of this movie is rajamouli never lost the sight of the story line. there are no deviations happening except for the story. who is the lead character in this movie? you guessed it.. the freaking story. so gotta give up to the director for making sure the story and purpose is not lost to ensure the actors their due screen presence. now coming to what's not great.. well, it's the thin story line. and the movie wasn't engaging at times. audience took their eyes off the screen here and there to be honest. never lost the story it wanted to tell.",the movie runs on a thin script very thin script the biggest merit of this movie is rajamouli never lost the sight of the story line there are no deviations happening except for the story who is the lead character in this movie you guessed it the freaking story so gotta give up to the director for making sure the story and purpose is not lost to ensure the actors their due screen presence now coming to whats not great well its the thin story line and the movie wasnt engaging at times audience took their eyes off the screen here and there to be honest never lost the story it wanted to tell,the movie runs on a thin script very thin script the biggest merit of this movie is rajamouli never lost the sight of the story line there are no deviations happening except for the story who is the lead character in this movie you guessed it the freaking story so gotta give up to the director for making sure the story and purpose is not lost to ensure the actors their due screen presence now coming to whats not great well its the thin story line and the movie wasnt engaging at times audience took their eyes off the screen here and there to be honest never lost the story it wanted to tell,movie runs thin script thin script biggest merit movie rajamouli never lost sight story line deviations happening except story lead character movie guessed freaking story gotta give director making sure story purpose lost ensure actors due screen presence coming whats great well thin story line movie wasnt engaging times audience took eyes screen honest never lost story wanted tell,movie runs thin script thin script biggest merit movie rajamouli never lost sight story line deviations happening except story lead character movie guessed breaking story gutta give director making sure story purpose lost ensure actors due screen presence coming what great well thin story line movie want engaging times audience took eyes screen honest never lost story wanted tell,"['movie', 'runs', 'thin', 'script', 'thin', 'script', 'biggest', 'merit', 'movie', 'rajamouli', 'never', 'lost', 'sight', 'story', 'line', 'deviations', 'happening', 'except', 'story', 'lead', 'character', 'movie', 'guessed', 'breaking', 'story', 'gutta', 'give', 'director', 'making', 'sure', 'story', 'purpose', 'lost', 'ensure', 'actors', 'due', 'screen', 'presence', 'coming', 'what', 'great', 'well', 'thin', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'want', 'engaging', 'times', 'audience', 'took', 'eyes', 'screen', 'honest', 'never', 'lost', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell']",movi run thin script thin script biggest merit movi rajamouli never lost sight stori line deviat happen except stori lead charact movi guess break stori gutta give director make sure stori purpos lost ensur actor due screen presenc come what great well thin stori line movi want engag time audienc took eye screen honest never lost stori want tell,movi run thin script thin script biggest merit movi rajamouli never lost sight stori line deviat happen except stori lead charact movi guess break stori gutta give director make sure stori purpos lost ensur actor due screen presenc come what great well thin stori line movi want engag time audienc took eye screen honest never lost stori want tell
A masterpiece. Full on entertainment and a visual treat,"Finally, the most awaited movie was released today. I watched RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores.

It's a visual treat. S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.

It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British Raj

Full action-packed movie. Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell.. Cinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .

Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.

Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.

Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.

Even the English actors were brilliant.

Making of the movie is so good like camera work, fight with animals, lights and all .

Technically a brilliant movie.

Some scenes are so mind-blowing .I kept thinking how did the director shot that and how he thought about such scenes.

This shows the brilliance of the director and his vision.

1st half is mind-blowing. You will love it 2nd half is stretched, slow, but you will never be bored.

It's a 3 hour long movie.

Enjoy this movie in Theater only because it's a visual treat .The animal fight scenes are superb .If you get a chance to watch it in 3D you will enjoy it more for sure.

After a long time, a big magnumplus blockbuster movie has come.

Watch it, and it's not to be missed.

I'm hoping this movie breaks all the records.

Don't miss the Sholay song at the end when they show the credits.. I give 9 out of 10 for this masterpiece.","finally, the most awaited movie was released today. i watched rrr (rise, roar, revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores. it's a visual treat. s s

The roar of RRR,"A great commercial cinema film with everything to offer comedy, drama, emotions and love. The most interesting part of RRR is the direction, how the film progresses and how the direction has been done makes this film so good.

RRRockkkk,"Finally, the most awaited movie was released today. I watched RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores.

It's a visual treat. S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.

It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British Raj

Full action-packed movie. Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell.. Cinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .

Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.

Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.

Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.

Even the English actors were brilliant.","finally, the most awaited movie was released today. i watched rrr (rise, roar, revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores. it's a visual treat. s s
